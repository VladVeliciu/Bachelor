# System for Automatic Greenhouse

Bachelor thesis project (2024) – Technical University of Cluj-Napoca  
Design and implementation of an **automated greenhouse monitoring and control system**.

## 💡 Overview
The system is built around an **ATmega64A microcontroller embedded on a custom 4-layer PCB**, integrating:
- 5 environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, soil quality, light, water level)
- Galvanic isolation for external sensor/actuator interfaces
- Wi-Fi module (ESP-12E) communicating via **MQTT** to **ThingsBoard**
- Control of water pump (PWM) and lighting (relay)
- **Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference** system regulating water flow based on air temperature and soil humidity

## 🌐 IoT Integration
- MQTT telemetry to **ThingsBoard** (open-source IoT platform)
- Remote dashboard & data logging
- Accessible from any network (Web UI)

## 🛠️ Main technologies
- ATmega64A, ESP-12E Wi-Fi module
- RS-485 with optocouplers
- Fuzzy logic (Takagi-Sugeno)
- PCB: 4 layers, mixed-signal separation & isolation

## 📄 Repository contents
- PCB schematics & Gerber files
- Firmware (C)
- Documentation / Thesis (PDF)
